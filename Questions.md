# Workshop Q&A

## Questions

### Briefly describe what version control systems are used for and give five reasons.
VCS tools manage and track software project changes, offering benefits like history tracking, collaboration, code backup, parallel development, and release management.

### What is Git, and why is it commonly used in software development?
Git is a distributed version control system used in software development to track changes in source code and collaborate with others. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously while keeping a history of changes and facilitating code management.

### How do you initialize a Git repository in a local directory?
To initialize a Git repository in a local directory, you can use the command git init. This command creates a hidden folder called ".git" in the directory, setting up the repository to track changes.

### What is the purpose of the `git add` command, and how does it work?
The `git add` command is used to stage changes for the next commit. You can use it to specify which files or changes you want to include in the upcoming commit. For example, `git add` filename stages a specific file, and `git add` . stages all changes in the current directory.

### How can you check the status of your Git repository using the "git status" command?
You can use the "git status" command to view the current state of your Git repository. It shows which files have been modified, which are staged for the next commit, and any untracked files.

### What does the `git commit` command do, and how do you provide a commit message?
The `git commit` command records the staged changes into the Git history. To provide a commit message, you can use the -m flag followed by a brief and descriptive message like this: `git commit -m "Added new feature"`

### What is a merge conflict in Git, and how can you resolve it?
A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches due to conflicting modifications in the same part of a file. To resolve a merge conflict, you need to manually edit the affected files, choose which changes to keep, remove the conflict markup and then commit the resolved files.

### What is the advantage of using branches in Git?
Git branches provide isolation for separate tasks, encourage collaboration, allow experimentation, ease code review, and help maintain a stable main branch.


## After Talk Questions

### What is the difference between commit and branch 
A commit in Git represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, including changes to files. A branch is a named reference that points to a specific commit. Commits are used to record changes, while branches allow you to work on multiple independent lines of development.

### What is the difference between Github and Gitlab?
GitHub and GitLab are valuable for collaboration, version control, and project management. They provide tools for tracking changes, collaborating with others, managing issues, and automating workflows, making them essential for software development and other collaborative projects.

### How do I create a pull request?
To create a pull request, first fork the repository on GitHub or GitLab, then clone it to your local machine. Create a new branch for your changes, commit your changes, and push them to your forked repository. Finally, go to the original repository and create a pull request from your branch to the main branch.

### How often do you use git/github in your work and what kinds of situations do you find it very helpful or when is it uneccessary? 
Git and GitHub play a crucial role in my work, and I use them extensively for most of my projects. I tend to use Git for version control even on smaller scripts that are solely for my use but are part of a project. However, for very tiny scripts or quick, one-time tasks, I may skip using Git altogether.
    When collaborating with colleagues who may not be familiar with Git, and the project is not software-centric, I often opt for collaboration tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. These tools allow live collaboration on documents, which is more suitable for non-technical team members working on reports, documentation, or other text-based projects. In such cases, Git and GitHub may become unnecessary, but they remain my go-to choice for code-related projects and larger collaborations.

### How much storage can you have in one repository? Is there a limit?
Both GitHub and GitLab have storage limits for individual repositories. The limits vary depending on the service and plan you are using. Generally, free plans have smaller storage limits, while paid plans offer more storage. It's important to check the specific platform's documentation for the most up-to-date information on storage limits.

### How do we work together?
Collaboration with Git and GitHub/GitLab involves creating branches, making changes, pushing commits, and creating pull requests. Multiple users can work on different branches and collaborate on a shared codebase. Communication through comments, issues, and pull requests is crucial for effective teamwork.

### How do I work with Nahja?
:D

### How do I think of a question?
Identify your topic or area of interest: Start by determining the subject or topic you want to inquire about. It could be related to a specific problem, concept, or information you seek.
    
Clarify your objective: Clearly define the purpose of your question. Are you seeking information, looking for a solution, exploring a concept, or trying to understand something better?

Phrase your question: Formulate your question in a clear, concise, and specific manner. Use interrogative words like "what," "why," "how," "when," "where," or "who" to begin your question, depending on the type of information you're seeking.

Consider context: Think about the context of your question and whether it requires additional background information or context for others to understand it better.

Be precise: Avoid vague or ambiguous language in your question. Make sure it's easy to understand and answer.

Test your question: Read your question aloud or to someone else to ensure it conveys your intended meaning and is free from any potential confusion.

Revise if necessary: If your question isn't clear or doesn't achieve your objective, don't hesitate to revise it until it accurately reflects your inquiry. :D

### Do you use TOR :D?
Probably, Maybe, do I?

### What is going on?????
Yes
