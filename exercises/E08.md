# E8 - Solving merge conflicts

When changing the same file in different branches, trying to merge may result in conflicts

When doing so the `git merge` command throws and error like:

```bash
git merge next
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

It tells you where the conflict is and what to do. Taking a look into README.md shows the following:

```text
 <<<<<<< HEAD
 Hello world
 =======
 Hello Git
 >>>>>>> feature-x
```

You have to fix this manually by deciding what the correct text should be. You may either decide to keep `Hello world` or go with `Hello Git`. But you could also combine to you liking, e.g. `Hello World, this is Git`.
When you are done fixing, by replacing everything between the `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` with the corrent text. Save the file, add it to the staging area and commit it.
