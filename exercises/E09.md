# E9 - Rebasing

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch called "feature" and switch to it.
3. Add a new file called "feature.txt" and make a commit.
4. Switch back to the "main" branch and make some changes to the existing files.
5. Now, make a commit on the main branch.
6. Now, switch back to the "feature" branch and rebase it on top of the latest "main" branch.
7. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the rebase.
8. Now, push the "feature" branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
9. Compare the "feature" branch before and after the rebase and observe the difference in commits.
