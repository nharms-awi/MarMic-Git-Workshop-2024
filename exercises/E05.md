E5 - Displaying differences

When entering `git diff` in the terminal you will see the difference between of the unstaged files and the rest of your repository

By using `git diff [<commit hash>|<branch>]` you may compare the current state of the repository with a specific commit or branch

Then there is `git diff [<commit hash>|<branch>] [<commit hash>|<branch>]`. You can compare branches with branches, commits with commits, branches with commits and the other way around. You get the idea.
