# Git Repository Hosting Platforms

When working with Git, it's not uncommon to use a hosting platform to store and share your repositories. These platforms provide a centralized location for developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage issues. Some popular examples include:

- GitHub: One of the most well-known and widely-used Git hosting platforms. It provides a wide range of features for collaboration, including pull requests, issues, and wikis.
- GitLab: An open-source Git hosting platform that also provides a wide range of collaboration tools and is often used by organizations and enterprises.
- Bitbucket: A Git and Mercurial hosting platform that is popular among developers working in smaller teams and organizations.
- Gitea: An open-source, self-hosted Git platform that is designed to be lightweight and easy to set up.

In this workshop, we'll be focusing on GitHub as our primary example, but many of the concepts and workflows we cover will be applicable to other platforms as well.

## Introduction to GitHub/GitLab

There are various Git hosting platforms available, but the most popular ones are GitHub and GitLab. Both of these platforms offer similar features. They allow you to create repositories, collaborate with other developers, and manage your projects. However, there are some differences between them that may influence which one you choose to use. Some of the key features of those hosting platforms include:

- A web-based interface for viewing and editing files
- The ability to collaborate on code with other developers
- Built-in code review tools
- Support for issue tracking and project management
- Automatic backups and versioning of your code

### Issues

Issue tracking systems allow you to easily track and manage bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to your project. You can create issues, assign them to team members, and track their progress. Additionally, you can create labels and milestones to help organize your issues and make it easier to find what you're looking for.

### Pull/Merge Requests

The Pull Requests (GitHub) or Merge Requests (GitLab) feature allows you to collaborate on code changes with other members of your team. You can submit code changes to a branch, and then request that they be merged into the main branch. Other team members can review the changes, leave comments, and vote on whether to accept the changes.

### Collaboration

The hosting platforms make it easy to collaborate on code with other developers. You can share access to your repositories, create branches for different features or bug fixes, and merge code changes together. Additionally, you can use pull requests to review and merge code changes, which helps ensure that all changes are thoroughly tested and reviewed before they are merged into the main branch.

### Wikis

Wikis allow you to easily create and share documentation for your project. You can create pages, add images, and organize your documentation using headings and links. Additionally, you can control access to your wiki, so that only certain team members can edit or view it.

### Pages

Pages is a feature of GitHub and GitLab that allows you to create and host websites directly from your repository. It's a simple and easy way to create a website for your project or personal use without having to set up and maintain your own web server. With GitHub Pages, you can create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or use a pre-built theme. You can also use it to host your project's documentation and other information, making it easily accessible to others.

### Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)

Continuous Integration allows you to automate tasks and workflows in your repository. You can set up a workflow to automatically build and test your code, deploy your application, or run other tasks whenever certain events occur in your project. This can be a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks and ensuring that your code is always in a releasable state.

### Projects/Issue Boards

Github projects and GitLab Issue Boards allow you to organize your work and track progress on multiple tasks at once. You can create boards, add columns, and move cards (which represent tasks) across the board. Additionally, you can add labels, assignees, and due dates to your cards, which makes it easy to see what needs to be done and who's responsible for it.

### More Features

There are many other features available on GitHub and GitLab. Some free, some paid. As you become more familiar with these platforms, you'll discover new ways to use them in your projects.
