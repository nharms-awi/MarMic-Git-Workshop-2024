# Git Repository Hosting Platforms

When working with Git, it's common to use hosting platforms to store and share repositories. These platforms provide centralized locations for developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and manage issues. Some popular examples include:

- **GitHub**: Widely known and used, GitHub offers a wide range of collaboration features, including pull requests, issues, and wikis.
- **GitLab**: An open-source Git hosting platform with robust collaboration tools, often chosen by organizations and enterprises.
- **Bitbucket**: Popular among smaller teams and organizations, Bitbucket supports Git and Mercurial.
- **Gitea**: A lightweight, self-hosted Git platform designed for easy setup.

In this workshop, we'll primarily focus on GitHub and Gitlab as our example, but many concepts and workflows apply to other platforms.

## Introduction to GitHub/GitLab

GitHub and GitLab are two leading Git hosting platforms, both offering similar features such as:

- A web-based interface for viewing and editing files.
- Collaborative coding with team members.
- Built-in code review tools.
- Support for issue tracking and project management.
- Automatic backups and versioning of code.

### Issue Tracking

Issue tracking systems help manage bugs, feature requests, and tasks related to your project. You can create, assign, and track issues, using labels and milestones for organization.

### Pull/Merge Requests

GitHub's Pull Requests (PRs) and GitLab's Merge Requests (MRs) enable collaborative code changes. Submit changes to a branch, then request their merge into the main branch. Team members review, comment, and vote on these changes.

### Collaboration

Hosting platforms simplify code collaboration. Share repository access, create branches for features or fixes, and merge code changes. PRs ensure thorough testing and review before merging.

### Wikis

Create and share project documentation with Wikis. Add pages, images, and organize content. Control access to ensure only certain members can edit or view.

### Pages

GitHub and GitLab's "Pages" feature hosts websites directly from your repository. Create project or personal websites easily without setting up a web server. It's great for hosting documentation and information for others to access.

### Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)

Automate tasks and workflows in your repository with Continuous Integration. Build, test, deploy, and more based on project events, ensuring code is always ready for release.

### Projects/Issue Boards

Organize and track multiple tasks with GitHub Projects and GitLab Issue Boards. Create boards, columns, and move task cards. Assign labels, due dates, and responsible team members for efficient project management.

### More Features

GitHub and GitLab offer many other features, some free and some paid. As you become familiar with these platforms, you'll discover innovative ways to enhance your projects.
